# RockRadio
Human Computer Interaction - Brock University final project

## Overview
This project was developed as a website with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Support for Javascript is required to properly view the project. This project has only been tested with Chrome. It will likely work as intended with other Webkit browsers such as Safari, but this has not been tested, and cross-browser compatibility was not taken into account. Only run this project with Google Chrome! Firefox breaks the CSS, and IE breaks everything. There are three aspects to this project:
-	The desktop website
-	The mobile app/website
- The desktop DJ admin page

## Desktop Site
The desktop website is located in the root directory of the project. To see the site, open `index.html` in Google Chrome. You can navigate to the other pages from here. There is also a “popup player” linked to on the main page, so you can listen to the station and navigate away from the home page.

## Mobile App
The mobile app was designed as a compact and simplified version of the desktop sites for small screens. In the root directory, open the file `mobile_app.html` in Google Chrome to view the mobile app. This was intended for screens 700px and smaller, so if you can’t actually view it on a phone, make your Chrome window narrow to view the page as intended.

## Admin Page
The admin page allows DJs to log in and queue songs to play on the station. There are various options on this page. To view the admin page as intended, navigate to the admin folder and open `index.html` in Google Chrome. This is a login page, and the username and password required to log in is listed on the page. Successful login will take you to `admin/admin.html` which is the main page for the DJs.
